# Review of Class 1 Examples

1.  Get the current system time and store as a variable.  Is this a POSIXct or POSIXlt object?
2.  Retrieve the year from this variable
3.  Create a monthly vector of date objects for 2018
4.  Create an hourly vector of POSIXct values for today
5.  Create a 4 year, quarterly time series dataset of random normal variables beginning in January 1990
6.  Load and plot the `sunspots` dataset with a horizontal red line showing the mean of the whole dataset
7.  Do a seasonal plot of the Australian Wine data (requires `forecast` package)
8.  Using Base R graphics, plot a logistic distribution of monthly values over a 3-year period beginning January 2018.  Add a blue line showing the trailing 3-period moving average and a red line showing the 2-sided 5 period moving average.

# R Notebooks

- Report Generation with R + Markdown

- Excellent means of sharing work &amp; collaborating

- Provides a method for clear presentation AND quickly getting to underlying code

- R Markdown vs. R Notebook:
  - R Notebook for sharing analytical practices
  - Perfect for building out knowledge &amp; consistency at an organization 
  - R Markdown for presenting results rather than how you got there

# Time Series Functions

- `aggregate` - subset and compute summary statistics
  
  - `nfrequency`
  
  - `FUN`

- `cycle` - positions in the cycle of each observation

- `window` - subset of the object between 2 times


---
# Smoothing

Smoothing methods can be applied to historical time series with the objective of identifying an underlying signal or trend.

Two widely used methods:

- Moving Average
- Loess
  - locally weighted
  - `stl` function in R
  - [Excellent example and code](http://varianceexplained.org/files/loess.html)


---
# Smoothing - Moving Average

- First step in classical decomposition is to use a moving average method to estimate the trend-cycle

- Observations that are nearby in time are likely to be close in value, average eliminates some randomness

- Moving averages usually done with odd-number if 2-sided so they are symmetrical


---
# Moving Averages of Moving Averages

Notation:  
- 4-MA moving average of 4 periods
- 2 x 4-MA two-period moving average of the 4-MA

- This creates a centred series with two even-numbered periods

- Most common usage is estimating the trend-cycle from seasonal data:

`$$\hat{T}_t = {1 \over 8}y_{t-2} + {1 \over 4}y_{t-1} + {1 \over 4}y_t + {1 \over 4}y_{t+1} + {1 \over 8}y_{t+2}$$`

---
# Time Series Decomposition

Additive vs. Multiplicative - does variance increase with time

- Additive:  `\(y_t = S_t + T_t + R_t\)`

- Multiplicative:  `\(y_t = S_t \times T_t \times R_t\)`

Alternative to using a multiplicative model is to transform the data until variation appears stable over time.

---
# Other widely used decomposition methods

- X11
  - US Census Bureau
  - Trend-cycle available for all observations
  - Seasonal component can vary slowly over time

- SEATS
  - Seasonal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series
  - Only works with quarterly and monthly data

- STL
  - Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using Loess
  - Handles many types of seasonality well
  - Seasonal change and smoothness can be controlled by user
  - Only provides facilities for additive decomposition

---
# Forecasting Decomposition

- Decomposition can be useful in forecasting as well as studying historical data

- Often assumed that the seasonal component is unchanging or changing very slowly
  - Seasonal naive is appropriate

- Seasonally adjusted component can be forecasted with any non-seasonal forecasting method (Random walk with drift, Holt-Winters, Non-seasonal ARIMA)

# Expectation

Expected value, commonly abbreviated to `\(expectation, E\)`, of a value is its *mean* value in a population.  So `\(E(x)\)` is the mean of `\(x\)`, denoted `\(\mu\)`

---
# Covariance

Covariance is a measure of *linear association*

$$ \gamma(x, y) = E[(x - \mu_x)(y - \mu_y)] $$
Sample covariance

`$$Cov(x, y) = \sum(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})/(n - 1)$$`


---
# Correlation

Dimensionless measure of the linear association between a pair of vairables.

Correlation takes a value between -1 and +1, with a value of 0 indicating no *linear* association.

Population correlation, `\(\rho\)`, between a pair of variables `\((x, y)\)` is:

`$$\rho(x, y) = {{E[(x - \mu_x)(y - \mu_y)]} \over {\sigma_x \sigma_y}} = {\gamma(x, y) \over {\sigma_x \sigma_y}}$$`

The sample correlation, `\(Cor\)`, is an estimate of `\(\rho\)` and is calculated by:

$$Cor(x, y) = {{Cov(x, y)} \over {sd(x)sd(y)}} $$

---
# Correlation

`cor`


```r
base_url &lt;- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smudgerville/IntroTimeSeriesWithR/master/"
cbe &lt;- read.table(paste0(base_url, "cbe.dat"), header = T)
with(cbe, cor(choc, elec))
```

```
## [1] 0.8130606
```

We've all heard it before but important to emphasize - correlation does not imply causality

---
# The ensemble and stationarity

Mean function of a time series model:  `\(u(t) = E(x_t)\)`

- Expectation is an average across the *ensemble* of all possible series produced by the model. (simulation)

- If the mean function is constant, we say that the time series model is *stationary* in the mean.

- Said another way, a stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed.

- In general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term. Time plots will show the series to be roughly horizontal (although some cyclic behaviour is possible), with constant variance.

---
# Variance function

Variance function of a time series model that is stationary in the mean is

`$$\sigma^2(t) = E[(x_t - \mu)^2]$$`

- This can in theory take a different value at every point in time.  

- However, we can't estimate variance from a single point.  

- Assumption is that model is stationary in the variance.

- In time series, sequential observations may be correlated.  With positive correlation, our model will tend to underestimate in a short series because successive observations are influenced by prior observations.

---
# Differencing

- Differencing is one way to make a time series stationary.

- Transformations such as logarithms can help to stabilize the variance of a time series.  

- Differencing can help stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level.


---
# Autocorrelation

With time series second-order properties play an important role

Serial correlation or Autocorrelation:  correlation of a variable with itself at different times.  

*Second-order stationary*: autocorrelation depends only on the number of steps between observations.

If a series is *second-order stationary*, then we can define an `\(autocovariance function (acvf), \gamma_k\)`, as a function of the lag `\(k\)`:

`$$\gamma_k = E[(x_t - \mu)(x_{t+k} - \mu)]$$`
Simiar to above relationship to covariance but replacing `\(y\)` with `\(x_{t+k}\)`, the lag `\(k\)` autocorrelation function `\((acf), \rho_k\)` is:

`$$\rho_k = {{\gamma_k} \over {\sigma^2}}$$`

Note:  general discussion will just refer to second-order as stationary.  

Similar to correlation, formula bounds possible values between -1 and 1.

---
# The correlogram

`acf` produces a plot by default.  Underneath it is a list.

Plot type is called correlogram.  Key features:
- *x*-axis give the lag `\((k)\)`.  Unit of lag is sampling interval
- Lag 0 is always 1 and is shown to help comparisons
- If `\(\rho_k = 0\)`, the sampling distribution of `\(r_k\)` is approximately normal, with a mean of `\(-1/n\)` and a variance of `\(1/n\)`.  Dotted lines are drawn at:

`$$-{1 \over n} \pm {2 \over \surd{n}}$$`

---
# Correlogram 

- ACF plot is useful for identifying non-stationary time series

- For a stationary time series, the ACF will drop to zero relatively quickly

- The ACF of non-stationary data decreases slowly.

---
## Second-order differencing

Occasionally the differenced data will not appear to be stationary and it may be necessary to differentiate a second time to obtain a stationary series.

--
## Seasonal differencing

A seasonal difference is the difference between an observation and the previous observation from the same season.

`$$y^*_t = y - y_{t-1}$$`

where `\(m\)` = the number of seasons.  Also called "lag-$m$ differences".  If seasonally differenced data appear to be white noise, then an appropriate model is:

`$$y_t = y_{t-m} + e_t$$`

---
## Tests for stationarity

- *unit root test*

- *Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test*

The null-hypotheses for an ADF is that the data are non-stationary.  Thus, small p-values suggest stationarity. 

- `adf.test` in *tseries* package
